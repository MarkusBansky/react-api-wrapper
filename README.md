###### These all above should be green!

It is a popular task to create a frontend on React for some API provided as a backend. 
This requires to use many plugins and different approaches which may be complicating to begin with.
Developers such as myself are required to write some duplicate code each time a new project is started.
This downgrades the efficiency of the team and wastes useful time. 

##### Do not waste your time on repetitiveness!

This project is dedicated to help developers connect their frontend written in React to the API endpoints.
By generating the reducers, mappings for `connect` function automatically this tool helps to reduce
the number of code required to get new API rolled out or the duplicate code rewritten every time.

##### Reduce the amount of written code!

This also reduces the number of packages required to be installed in order to get the required 
functions to work with the API backend.
